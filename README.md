## My process

### Built with

- ![Vite][vite]
- ![NPM][npm]
- ![HTML][html]
- ![CSS][css]
- ![Tailwind CSS][tailwind-css]
- ![Google fonts][google-fonts]
- ![Flexbox][flexbox]

### What I learned

1.  **Responsive Images with Tailwind CSS**: One key thing I learned was how to switch images based on screen size using Tailwind's utility classes. This helped me create a better user experience across different devices.

    Using Tailwindâ€™s hidden and block classes, I used responsive utility classes to show or hide images based on screen width. For example:

    ```html
    <div class="img_container lg:flex-1/2">
    	<img
    		src="src/images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    		alt="Gabrielle perfume mobile image"
    		class="object-cover lg:hidden"
    	/>
    	<img
    		src="src/images/image-product-desktop.jpg"
    		alt="Gabrielle perfume desktop image"
    		class="hidden lg:block lg:w-full lg:h-full"
    	/>
    </div>
    ```
